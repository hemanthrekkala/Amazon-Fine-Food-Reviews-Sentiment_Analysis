Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow).

Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan.

       " \" The wine saver is great in so many ways. Obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. This lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. If you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. The wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  I do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. Just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red.\\n\",\n",

       " \" I was very skeptical when I bought this item, so imagine my amazement when I discovered that it actually works!  Prior to buying VacuVin, my red wine bottles would last a maximum of 1-2 days if immediately re-corked, and white wine a few days longer if refrigerated.  Now, my red wine is good for up to a week, and the white wine lasts even longer.  The device is very simple - it pumps air through a plastic cork to re-create the original pressure prior to opening.  Simple to use, and the corks are easy to rinse.  Perfect for single people like me who don't want to drink a full bottle in one sitting, or who may switch from red one night to white the next.\\n\",\n",
       " \" I've been using Vacu Vin's previous model for years and have been happy with it.  The one downside of the earlier offering was that wine lovers never knew when a vacuum was achieved.  I used to overpump just to make sure the wine-damaging oxygen was out of the bottle.<p>I got this model in Napa a few months ago and I'm glad I did.  While it doesn't deliver on its Concerto promise, it does give you reassuring clicks when a vacuum has been reached, enabling you to stop pumping sooner.  It's a nice refinement.<p>The only downside over the previous model is that it won't work with the marinating device sold separately because the bottom is configured differently from the earlier model.\\n\",\n",

And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.<p>For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle. <p>Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.\\n',\n",

       " ' Finally, a collection of the best Camper Van Beethoven albums (I think there is one album missing from the band, a  major label release with intentionally clean over-production).  I had been waiting years for this dream CD, as I only possessed each one in vinyl.  <p>Some people like to listen to a full album that has a recognizable identity in its sonic experience.  You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a \"Flexible Soup\".  It\\'s anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery\\'s penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They\\'re simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I\\'ve held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band\\'s intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask \"Why?\", yet with an immediate second thought you\\'ll smile and say \"Why hasn\\'t Anyone Else?\"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I\\'ve caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.

I had been waiting years for this dream CD, as I only possessed each one in vinyl.  <p>Some people like to listen to a full album that has a recognizable identity in its sonic experience.  You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a \"Flexible Soup\".  It\\'s anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery\\'s penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They\\'re simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I\\'ve held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band\\'s intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask \"Why?\", yet with an immediate second thought you\\'ll smile and say \"Why hasn\\'t Anyone Else?\"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I\\'ve caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today\\'s music. ]\\n',\n",

Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever!

You end up spending close to [...] a month for litter for two cats.<p>So when I saw Swheat Scoop for about half the price I thought I'd try it.  It was similar to World's Best in that it's made from wheat so it's flushable and natural.  Only problem is it works horribly in the automatic box, although they claim it can be used there.  The cat's liquid waste turns the litter into a pasty, sticky gob that sticks to the litter box bottom and/or to the rakes when they come by to clean the box.

       " \" Few things I'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<p>Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<p>That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<p>Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.\\n\",\n",

       " ' I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine.  As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make. A teaspoon of real vanilla or almond extract improves the flavor.  I like to make the chocolate cake with iced coffee.  Then rather than use sugar free frosting (ugggh!) I sprinkle the top with either unsweetened cocoa or with chopped coffee beans.  The bitterness of the cocoa and the coffee beans enhances the sweetness of the cake. These mixes make a very thin eight-inch layer.

I enjoy using the Sweet 'N Low cake mixes so the first few times I used this product I assumed I had not followed the directions properly.

I use these in place of vegetable or olive oil whenever a dish calls for a similar flavor ingredient (to give it the extra flavor &quot;kick&quot;), but I found myself using them sparingly since I didn't know where to find more when they're gone! I'm almost out of the bottles I bought (just opened 2 of them, and they're fresh as ever!) and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon! The Lemon oil makes a wonderful Greek Saganaki (flamed Feta or Kaseri cheese), the Lime oil is fantastic for Thai cooking and it's many lime-based dishes, and the Orange oil I use in Salmon marinades, as well as with Oriental stir-fry &amp; Chinese duck--I may even try it in making Duck a L'Orange! I don't recall what I paid when I initially purchased them, but as gourmet oils are pricey to begin with, I would consider this a reasonable price, especially considering Amazon's free shipping &amp; the convenience of to-your-door delivery!

       " \" Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<p>New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.  <p>The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the &quot;red kidney bean&quot; popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<p>Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.\\n\",\n",

This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.<br /><br />Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon.

A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.<p>In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy.

Their flavor is very light and seasoning is needed but this is a plus for me as I can season to taste.<p>I have also mixed these with traditional bread crumbs at times as these tend to be expensive for a lighter style coating but still essentially very much like all panko dishes.  I tend to use a light egg wash with these as I find using just eggs to dip the meat/poulty/fish in a bit heavy for these crumbs.  <p>In general I find these far superior for coating food.  These aren't the kind of bread crumbs I use for adding bulk (ie meatloaf, meatballs etc).  I have been using these for a few years now an there is a huge difference between these and the others.

Although made with peppers and relatively hot, the sauce has a generous helping of garlic taste that really perks up food.  It's ideal for Asian recipes, but it can be used with any food to which you want to add some heat, including soups, pasta, and chicken wings (the company also has a website that includes some excellent recipes).

       " \" Blair isn't joking: that plastic skull is a cogent, stark warning not to take this sauce lightly.  And another note: this isn't so much a sauce as it is an additive.<p>Here's how you can literally fire up your mouth: take one 24 ounce jar of generic hot salsa from your supermarket.  Let's say you laugh at their idea of &quot;hot&quot;, which means you're ready to go with Blair's Sudden Death Sauce.<p>Put the salsa in a blender.  Do not blend yet.  Pour about 1/4&quot; of water in the empty jar, shake it up, pour into the blender (get all of your salsa's worth).  Put four-six drops of Blair's into the blender.  Cover and blend on &quot;Liquify&quot;.<p>Pour into a serving bowl.  Take a nacho chip, dip, and eat.  Now run to your  kitchen sink, and stick your mouth under the tap.  After five minutes, the burning should stop.<p>Repeat until the bag of chips are gone.<p>I add a few drops to canned chicken soup, and it really makes it far more tasty and hot than you could ever buy.  I'm impressed at how tasty the sauce really is, if you use it properly.  It takes a little practice to get the right balance of flavor-to-hot, but it really does add flavor to soups, salads, chili (man, does it ever), hamburger, just about anything.  A single bottle might last you about three months, and you'll sneer at lesser sauces in your grocer's aisles.<p>fred\\n\",\n",
       " \" I was first turned onto this chocolate when I visited a private Mexican themed coffee shop. I love a good mocha and that's usually how I judge a coffee shop first. This mocha was one-of-a-kind! I had to know what was in it. It was IBARRA!<p>Basically, Mexican chocolate is pure cocoa with cinnamon. IBARRA also adds some sugar and an emulsifier (which is why I only give it 4 stars). I have made mochas and hot chocolates at home and my guests think I'm a god (maybe an Aztec god!). It just really brings an orginal taste unlike any of those other cheap sugary brands (Nestle, Hershey's, ect.). <p>I highly recommend it. But two suggestions: IBARRA comes in &quot;bricks&quot; that you must chop or grind. We use a coffee bean grinder, but make sure it's a good quality grinder or cut the pieces into smaller pieces. Otherwise you might have a broken coffee bean grinder. For a real authentic feel you can use a stone and pistol just fine. And a recipe suggestion: Grind a portion of a Hazelnut for an added spice. ENJOY!\\n\",\n",

Life is good.\" ~tea packet<br /><br />If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey. I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely. I think it is the slightly nutty flavor of the Darjeeling.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India\\'s border with Bhutan. There are only \"true Darjeeling\" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using \"milk powder\" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them. When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />For more information on the mysteries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />For a calming experience try the Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion which is perfect for quiet evenings, after completing a yoga workout or just to sip on while you write in<br />your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\\n',\n",
       " ' Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  \"dark brown sugar\" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I\\'ve been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is \"green cut.\" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can\\'t be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\\n',\n",

It has a rich, full-bodied flavor, neither bitter nor astringent. The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup, 2 4 oz cups, or a single 8 oz cup at a time. The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2&quot; in diameter.<p>Right now, the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup. The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top, and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up, or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do.<p>I do envision the price point coming down a bit, as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation.

It is the spice of &quot;kheer&quot;--Indian rice pudding, where sometimes the whole green pods are thrown in. I use it in tea or even coffee, bruising the black seeds slightly with the pestle. It is also commonly used in pilau (pilaf) or biryani, that festive Indian rice and meat or vegetable cassarole. Scandinavian cooking uses this spice in many cookies and cakes. <p>If you aren't used to the flavor, it can be a bit startling--not sweet and spicey like cinnamon or nutmeg.

She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys, especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.

       " \" I bought the Raisin Brown Bread today on a whim at the grocery store (Publix in Florida) and I really liked it. Of special interest to me was the fact that no refined white sugar is used to sweeten it (only molasses) and no white flour is used (only whole wheat and rye flours). This bread is therefore quite closer to a South Beach Diet-acceptable &quot;dessert&quot; versus something you'd get in a typical bakery (with the possible exception of the molasses...didn't read that far).<p>The raisins were sweet and delicious and the bread is rich and hearty. I paid $1.99 locally and found it to be a very good value. It was flavorful and delicious enough by itself that butter actually was a negative when I tried it! That doesn't happen often.<p>I would recommend you try this product at least once to see what you think. I think it would be great to keep on hand as a snack, as one can could easily last you a few days of snacking.\\n\",\n",

Excited about my new machine, I brewed my first cups of coffee only to be disappointed, not by the machine itself (awesome!), but by the quality of the coffee.  The light roast was so-so, and the medium TERRIBLE.  I quickly ordered the dark to compare, and can now HIGHLY recommend the dark roast over the other two options.  The dark also works the best in espresso-like brewing mode, using two-pods with the 1-cup setting.

       " \" After spending 2 weeks in the Netherlands last year, I was hooked on Douwe Egberts coffee and found one place in all of Dallas/Ft. Worth that sold it. Finally! America gets Senseo! The coffee I woke up to for 2 weeks and loved. The medium and dark roast are my favorites. Douwe Egbert is excellent coffee. Once you've tasted this high quality Dutch coffee, you'll never go back to American/Columbian nor that burnt stuff sold in those bookstores. Hopefully prices for the coffee will come down. For now, it's cheaper for my friend to ship me Senseo coffee from Holland (package of 18 pads there is less than 2 Euro) than to buy it here in the States or online. Now I will celebrate SENSEO DAY, the day I received my Senseo machine (tho it arrived without the free coffee cups) every year!\\n\",\n",
       " \" Having received some Blue D'Auvergne along with several other artisan cheeses this Xmas, I was very pleased with the smoothness of this Blue. Unlike the more famous roquefort, D'Auvergne is slightly milder, with less of an after-flavor.  It does not overpower one's tastes and is a good choice for those looking for the strength of a french Bleu but wishing to avoid offending delicate palettes.  <p>This cheese is made from Sheep's Milk and contains the famed veins of blueish bacteria that give the cheese its signature flavor. This Blue was not wet nor sticky as many of the trendier Blues of late seem to have become. Neither has it the overly dry texture of say an English Blue Stilton, a traditional holiday Blue cheese on its own or in combination with the English Gloucster Cheddar and referred to as &quot;Huntsman&quot; cheese, whcih is very pretty, but suitable only as a dessert cheese or for afternoon Tea owing to its dryness.<p>Blue D'Auvergne, on the other hand, has a subtle creamy texture without being overly moist. Some Bleus err on the side of moistness now to the point of being more similar to a triple-creme.  Not so this Bleu. D'Auvergne slices well with the proper cutlery and can be crumbled if you'd like it that way.  It melted well atop a pear tart we made and complimented the sandy sweetness of the pears wtihout overpowering their delicate flavor &amp; scent as a Bleu such as Roquefort would have easily done.  This is a fine addition to the French Bleus and it was a pleasure to have on hand at a time when rich foods were bieng served and the D'Auvergne could be used to sprinkle atop a lightly seared Filet mignon with a sultana reduction sauce or tossed into a simple salad of dandilion greens, leftover crushed walnuts,and nasturtium vinegrette. The possibilities are endless.<p>This cheese was not too rich but was just rich enough to enhance any dish it graced. It's light tang was never overpowering, rather it added a gentle dash of excitment to the foods with which we paired it. Although there was none left over for a simpler dish, I would have loved to have tried it on its own either with wine or as part of a fruit plate.  I look forward to getting more of this fine cheese.\\n\",\n",

It is all natural and doesn\\'t contain any preservatives. You can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. I\\'ve used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn\\'t have any \"gluten\" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 ½ cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don\\'t seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob\\'s Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled. It is now the only operating waterwheel gristmill in Illinois. While Bob\\'s Red Mill products don\\'t arrive in a cloth bag, the paper bags do have an old fashioned feel and have a string-sewn closure. I love the crinkly sound of the high-quality paper bags.<br /><br />Bob\\'s Red Mill uses slow turning, 100-year-old millstones to naturally grind together the bran, endosperm and germ that contains the nutritious oil. This is a \"cool stone grinding process\" which preserves nutrients normally lost in high-speed, high-heat milling.<br /><br />This company produces more than 400 products.

       " \" Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\n\",\n",

In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\n\",\n",

While I would bet most people use this sauce as an additive in other foods like salsa or chili, I like to put it on burittos (the football sized ones from mexican resturants), about one drop every third bite. But if you eat it that way, be prepared to pay the price. Your mouth will burn with no relief in sight. Your sinuses will clear and your nose will run uncontrollably. Your eyes may turn red, and you might have a hard time breathing. And don't forget about that second burn, the next time you use the toilet (that is a serious warning. I was at a mexican resturant with a friend who ate dave's on his burrito. Dave's kicked in and he had to go. Everyone in the resturant could hear him howling in pain while he was in the bathroom). I only know of one other person who can eat the sauce as a sauce. Everyone else who has tried it has begged for an ambulance or help. It is that hot. And I love it.<p>One other note. If you use it as an additive, a little will crank up the heat level of most foods. If you don't think the hot salsa from the grocery store is hot, a few drops of this will make that salsa much hotter. But do yourself a favor, and make your own salsa. It is easy. I chop up two jalepenjo peppers, a onions, a can of diced tomatoes, maybe subsitute a chipolte if i want more sweetness, the juice of a lime, and a dash of dave's. Salt it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. After an hour, drain the liquid into the blender, and add in one more can of canned tomatoes. Blend it, and then add it back to the salsa mixing it up. For something different, chop up a bit of mint for the salsa. It will give an odd taste.

For example, this product won the 2000 Fancy Food Show's Gold Trophy for spreads/sweet toppings. <p>All in all, I advise you to indulge yourself and give &quot;La Salamandra&quot;'s dulce de leche a try. The price isn't overly high, so you don't have much to lose, and all to win :)<p>Belen Alcat\\n\",\n",
       " ' You have heard the story about how the Baby Ruth candy bear was not named for Babe Ruth but for Ruth Cleveland, daughter of President Grover Cleveland.  Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  The first Baby Ruth bars were made by the Curtiss Candy Company, which was founded in Chicago in 1916 by Otto Schnering, who used his mother\\'s maiden name since it was much more American-sounding and would not cause the problems that a German surname would during World War I.  The first confection made by Curtiss was the Kandy Kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  Then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  Priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, Schnering named it the Baby Ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.<br /><br />Now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for \"Baby\" Ruth Cleveland, the former President\\'s first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the Curtiss Candy Company since the 1920\\'s while the Babe Ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since Ruth had joine the Yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the Baby Ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  However, the idea that the Baby Ruth bar was named after Ruth Cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.<br /><br />The more reasonable explanation seems that the Curtiss Candy Company did indeed find a way to link their product to the Yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  Ironically, Curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the Babe Ruth Home Run Bar, endorsed by the Babe himself.  The Curtiss claim that the bar was named for Ruth Cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  The fact that Curtiss maintained for years that the Baby Ruth bar came out before years before Babe Ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 Ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.<br /><br />Of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic American candy bar.  Beneath the milk chocolate coating of Nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  In terms of caloric ration the Baby Ruth is 46% Carbs, 48% Fats, and 6% Protein.  The candy bar is low in Sodium and very low in Cholesterol, which is good, but high in Saturated Fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  A large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  If you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the Baby Ruth is still a good choice.<br /><br />Ironically, I did find a Champion Cocker Spaniel named Baby Ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for President Cleveland\\'s daughter, Ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the White House the previous year.  She was bred by Joseph Smith of Canada and sold to Andrew Laidlaw and became the foundation on which Mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the United States.  All three Best in Show Cocker Spaniels at the Westminster Dog Show could trace their pedigree back to this particular Baby Ruth.\\n',\n",

       " \" Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.\\n\",\n",

I could smell the pinapple juice in it. It made me think of the tropics. <p>Now to put the taste in context. I eat Dave's Insanity Sauce and have no problem with the heat, as a matter of fact I asked the salesperson for something hotter because I was getting used to eating very hot foods. I eat Blair's Sudden Death Sauce and think it has good heat. But Da Bomb was easily so much hotter than those two it burned my tounge like nothing else I have tried. I found myself by the kitchen sink washing my mouth with water. For those who eat tobasco, move on, this is like asking for car battery acid.

Sudden Death will give a good burn to just about anyone but the most serious chili heads. <p>What I like about this sauce the most is the flavor. It is very good.

I certainly do not consider myself a connoisseur of coffee, but spending on average $30 a week at Starbucks makes me at least an average coffee consumer.<br /><br /> To agree with other reviewers, the taste is not comparable to a freshly-made Starbucks. The Senseo is what it is-a home coffee maker under $70. Starbucks not only controls every element of the process, but uses significantly more sophisticated equipment. Importantly, the Senseo is worth the money.<br /><br /> As a work-at-home businessperson I enjoy having a fresh cup on my desk. The frothy result of the Senseo simulates a latte when you add hot milk to the final cup of coffee. (Never put milk in the Senseo!)<br /><br /> The dark roast is my favorite, but I find that I have to switch to the medium roast decaf after the first cup to keep from bouncing off the walls.<br /><br /> As I said, it will not equally substitue for a fresh Starbucks, but it is fast, enjoyable and easy to use.

It's pricey and the cans are very small, but if you want to spoil your cat for his birthday, holidays, etc., then they're great for that. My cat doesn't really care for most of them - he prefers the chicken hearts and livers the most, but could care less if he has it or not. I buy these occasionally, but it really isn't worth it too much for me to do so because he just doesn't care that much about the taste. It doesn't drive him to his dish and actually, he leaves a lot of it there and just wants his regular old Friskies.

Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead.\\n\",\n",

This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one.\\n\",\n",

He will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly.  But, he still doesn't want it more than 2-3 times a month because it's fish - not exactly his favorite food.

I think they could definitely do better on this variety -maybe even add cheese to it!  My cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 Lives version.\\n\",\n",
       " \" According to its makers, Cholula has been available in Mexico for three generations and imported to the U.S. for about 12 years. Named after a region of Mexico known for its ruins and ancient sites, Cholula is quickly becoming a hot sauce staple in the U.S. The bottle is a classic, with the yellow label, picture of a woman, and wood cap (the wood contains a plastic cap so that the sauce won't be contaminated).<br /><br /> The main ingredient of Cholula is the piquin pepper (also sometimes spelled &quot;pequin&quot;), which is a dried chile with the formal name &quot;capsicum annuum.&quot; In terms of flavor, Cholula is definitely distinctive. The dried chiles add a slightly smoky essence with more dimension than Tabasco or similar hot sauces. The heat level is fairly moderate, which allows the sauce to season your food while not overwhelming it. However, the sauce sometimes seems a little watery or bland.<br /><br /> Cholula adds great flavor to a variety of foods, although I like it best on scrambled eggs; a plethora of recipes are available on the official website. With only 20mg of sodium per teaspoon, Cholula is one of the best sauces available for persons trying to avoid sodium. However, it may taste a bit plain to persons who enjoy a high salt content in their hot sauce.\\n\",\n",
       " \" This is my cat's favorite one.  He just licks that bowl clean whenever he gets it.  I usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out, other cats must love it too.  The cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty.  It's just a very nice variety and something I'm sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.  Give this one a try - you'll be glad you did!\\n\",\n",
       " \" I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.\\n\",\n",
       " \" This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure.\\n\",\n",

He loves the carved versions the best, but he tolerates this one as one of those I use for a little change of pace for my cat.  He appreciates it some, I think, but seldom eats the entire can.  But I really would like to know what it consists of so I know what he's eating.  The gravy sure looks nice and the pieces are a nice size as well - not too big so he can get it into his small mouth.\\n\",\n",
       " \" Each cat I've had really likes this variety.  They prefer the sliced versions over the ground such as this, but if I buy ground, they only like this one.  It smells pretty normal - not too stinky to make you faint, but it seems more appealing than most cat foods do.  I get pretty positive results with this variety and a lot of purring!\\n\",\n",
       " \" My cat loved these! But, I don't know how he ever enjoyed them - he just swallows them whole! Not a tooth mark in any of them so he didn't really get to enjoy the gooey centers.  But, he really liked them otherwise and chewed a couple here and there.  They're really small so if your cat has a small mouth, then this one would be a good choice.  I have to buy these for my cat's bad teeth and he really appreciates them! They do a good job in keeping his teeth clean so I don't have to brush them so often.  Love that!\\n\",\n",

       " \" This is my cat's second favorite food.  He's not a senior but he just goes wild over this stuff.  I have to give it to him quite often because he just smells it in the cabinet, I think.  Between this one and the turkey and cheese, I should have been offered stock in the company by now.  There are many, many cases of this stuff that comes home for our cat.  He loves it that much.\\n\",\n",
       " \" If your cat loves poultry and ground food, this is a great one.  My previous cat loved this stuff, but my current cat just doesn't like the ground variety as well.  He prefers the food with chunks and gobbles it right up.  I've bought tons of this food over the years and many of my cats just loved it.  It just depends on your cat - if you have one that likes ground, give this one a try!\\n\",\n",
       " \" Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it.\\n\",\n",
       " ' I like this item B0001ES9FI very much You should read more reviews to find out more about it\\n',\n",
       " \" This one slipped from my cat's favorite, to being almost out of the picture.  He eats it still, but wants the carved varieties more.  I buy this so much that I think he can smell it through the can when I bring it home.  It's a great food - the pieces are just the right size and not too big for my cat's unusually small mouth.  Friskies makes a great food according to my cat!\\n\",\n",
       " ' Extremely tasty and the mustard seeds add a nice nubbly texture (the seeds are not hard).  Fantastic melted over bread or by itself.  Its only drawback is that you want to eat it all in one sitting.\\n',\n",
       " \" Again, this is one of those varieties that you use as a &quot;variety&quot; from your cat's regular likes. I toss this one in whenver I can find it in the store and my cat just eats it like well, I have to eat this, don't I? It's not his favorite but he does choke it down somehow. He doesn't leave this one so he likes it somewhat. It's ground, so that isn't his favorite but you can actually see vegetables in this one. I like that part so that's why I buy it.\\n\",\n",
       " \" This variety seems to be more shredded when you open the can - sorta like Shredded Wheat cereal in appearance.  Because of that, I think it's getting stuck in my cat's teeth whenever he tries to eat it because he's always using his paw to try to get the food out of his teeth.  He won't eat this anymore at all - he figures out what it is and that's it.  It's a great idea, but it seems to fray and get stuck in his teeth.  He gets a little aggravated over it so I took all of them back to the store.\\n\",\n",
       " \" This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite.\\n\",\n",
       " \" My cat isn't a huge fish fan so I don't buy these as often as I do the others.  But, I use these to offer him some variety and since Friskies put the tuna in this one, my cat likes it much better.  He didn't like it with just the whitefish and I could seldom get him to eat the entire can.  These cans are huge so if you have a cat that loves his fish, then this is a great buy.  Otherwise, stick to the smaller ones for the picky guys.  Mine likes this once a month or so, but that's about it.\\n\",\n",
       " \" This version is ground.  NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others.\\n\",\n",
       " \" I'm a big fan of gouda, and I love the smoked flavor, so this cheese was a big hit for me.  However, the cheese has a slight 'plasticied' consistency.  It's hard to explain except that it didn't melt like other normal goudas I've had in the past.  It's great for slicing up and putting on turkey sandwiches.  Also makes a nice snack when cut into small wedges.  I don't think this would go well in a fondu, unless you used it in combination with another blander type base cheese for your sauce.\\n\",\n",
       " \" This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner.\\n\",\n",
       " \" I received a very well packaged (and promptly shipped even) package of the Habanero Jerky from Mahogany Smoked Meats.<br /><br /> The jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from Oberto or whomever). The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar.<br /><br /> However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well.<br /><br /> As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way.<br /><br /> The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.<br /><br /> Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.<br /><br /> I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.<br /><br /> Definitely recommended.\\n\",\n",

       " \" Evilspeak (1982), written and directed by Eric Weston, features Ron Howard's lesser known, but more prolific brother Clint Howard (both started out on the classic television series The Andy Griffith Show, as Opie and Leon, respectively).  During the 70's, both brothers starred in a spate of schlocky B movies like Eat My Dust! (1976) and Grand Theft Auto (1977), (most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children) to name a couple, and while brother Ron used the opportunity to get into directing (he directed the latter of the two films mentioned), his brother Clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras, enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the Hollywood fringe, managing to develop a long, successful career out of it, even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films (ahhh, sweet nepotism), like Far and Away (1992), Apollo 13 (1995), and Edtv (1999), but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the B movie, and it seems to fit him perfectly.<br /><br />In this film, Clint plays Stanley Coopersmith, a cadet at a military school.  Stanley possesses an above average IQ, is odd looking, an orphan, a loner, and is highly uncoordinated (his fumbling of the ball during the school's soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach).  All of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by Bubba (played by Don Stark, whom I recognized but couldn't place until I read that he currently appears on the TV show That 70's Show as the goofy neighbor Bob Pinciotti...man, he's really changed, and not for the better).  They harass Stanley constantly, playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable.  Stanley is also harassed by others, like his soccer coach, the school's commandant, and even the school's priest, to some degree.  What's a nerd to do?  Well, the answer comes one day while Stanley is cleaning the basement of the school's church as punishment, which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of America for their heresy in following religions darker path.  Stanley finds a secret room, which contains many things, including a dark tome, spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass.  With the help of an Apple computer borrowed from the school's library, Stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors, but will he get more than he bargained for?  You bet he will...<br /><br />Clint is always fun to watch, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn't have been my first choice, but to each his own.  The story itself is pretty solid, despite various plot holes, and moves along at a steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout until the film's end.  There is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness, specifically near the end of the film, along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women (the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd, as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands, as if it was partially deflated somehow, but I digress).  One thing I found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on Stanley's tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him.  Decapitations, death by possessed pig, removal of vital organs, etc., it's here and more.  Clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast, including veteran film and television actors R.G. Armstrong (Race with the Devil), Joseph Cortese (American History X), Claude Earl Jones (Used Cars), Heywood Nelson (Dwayne from the TV show What's Happening!), and Charles Tyner (The Outlaw Josey Wales).  Probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics, but I found it kind of charming, in its' own cheesy way.  The film's not really scary, but it does get pretty graphic, and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film.<br /><br />This release from Anchor Bay Entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film, which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the MPAA's (Motion Picture Association of America) ever changing archaic rules and regulations (this is the group that gave the film Midnight Cowboy, which later won the Oscar for best picture, an unnecessary X rating at the time of its' release) have been put back in...this is one of my favorite aspects about the DVD format, being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen, before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear censorship board.  The special features contained on this release include a good-looking wide screen format (some scratches are present), an entertaining audio commentary by writer/producer/director Eric Weston, a production cast member named Warren Lewis, and star Clint Howard, a original theatrical trailer, biographies, a photo gallery, and booklet insert with liner notes.  If I learned anything from this film, it's that it's not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises.  It certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of punishment, allowing for a less than surefooted victim to slip and fall into all sorts of nastiness...pig guano...ewwwww...overall, this is a three star film with an extra star for the special features.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />PS...look for Richard Moll, Bull on TV's Night Court, as Father Esteban...\\n\",\n",

I\\'ve used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn\\'t have any \"gluten\" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 ½ cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don\\'t seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob\\'s Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled.

       " ' These days, when a person says, \"chicken soup\" they\\'re probably going to follow up those words with, \"for the soul\" or maybe \"for the teenaged soul\".  Didn\\'t used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"chicken soup\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"with rice!\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak\\'s catchy 1962 children\\'s book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn\\'t dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak\\'s other great rhyming tale \"Pierre\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It\\'s a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there\\'s robin\\'s nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child\\'s reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you\\'re just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven\\'t found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\" with the correct oomph, you\\'re missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"Chicken Soup With Rice\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin\\' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It\\'s Sendak at his finest.\\n',\n",
       " \" Summary:  A young boy describes the usefulness of chicken soup with rice for each month of the year.<br /><br />Evaluation:  With Sendak's creative repetitious and rhythmic words, children will enjoy and learn to read the story of a boy who loves chicken soup with rice!  Through Sendak's catchy story, children will also learn the months of the year, as well as what seasons go with what month! They learn to identify ice-skating and snowmen in the winter; strong wind in March; birds and flowers in the spring; swimming and hot temperatures in the summer; and finally different holidays throughout the year. Such as Halloween in October, and Christmas in December.<br /><br />Sendak's simple three colored crayon-like drawings are a perfect addition to his educational and entertaining story.<br /><br />A great activity that you can do with this book is to have children draw their own illustrations for each month of the year.  Afterwards you can bind the pages together so the children can create their own book.\\n\",\n",

       " ' So many black teas (such as pu-erh and yunnan) are so strong and stark, that to find a tea like this (which is assam and ceylon with herbs) is a real treat. First off, make no bones about it, this is a black tea. It has that strong, bitter taste to it that I look forward to from a black tea. However, the aroma is just incredible. Between the cloves and the cinnamon, it\\'s almost as if you\\'ve opened up a box of christmas. The tea itself is very rich and very dark. It produces a little froth on its own, mainly I think because the leaves are so broken up. You\\'ll want a very fine filter, there is sediment through the filter we use.<br /><br />The tea itself has a very strong character of both clove and orange, with cinnamon making the tea very much \"spicy.\" Not spicy enough to detract from the rest of the tea, but certainly enough to get your attention. The box mentions there are 3 kinds of cinnamon in the tea as well. This much I\\'d believe. I know there are at least two kinds -- Sri Lanka and Madagascar -- of cinnamon, it seems reasonable to me that a third might be adding the \"sweet\" flavor that the other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />It is really just an amazing tea that I think most people will find themselves going through quickly. It\\'s a nice break from the standard black tea fare, if that\\'s what you normally drink.<br /><br />I can compare it to Rishi Tea\\'s \"The Fire\" (another \"spicy\" tea), and the big difference here is the body. Rishi\\'s offering has a very light boody, whereas this tea almost tastes like it\\'s had molasses added. Yum. All the spice, and character to boot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\\n',\n",

       " ' For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvan\\'s series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon.  Most of us know the legend in it\\'s more modern form as the \"Mrs. Field\\'s Chocolate Chip cookie recipe\" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost \"Two-forty\" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240.  Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil\\'s Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it.  It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting.  The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons.  Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.<br /><br />Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake.  The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting.  When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation.  You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend.  The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!<br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries.  The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn\\'t all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to \"legendary\" ) recipes.<br /><br />You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices.  Do what I do and make your own!  Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here.  Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its \"Star Quality\" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece!  I know of one mom whose daughter got an \\'A\\' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!<br /><br />If all that info isn\\'t enough inducement to try it...just remember..it\\'s chocolate cake for heaven\\'s sake!

The canned filling also uses just the heart of the sweet potato, what most people call \"Yams\" so you get a better overall resultthat is smoother and sweeter than if you go about making a pie the old-fashioned way.  An added benefit is less mess and ease of clean-up.<br /><br />Unless you live in an area where Southern Cooking ingredients are easily available at the supermarket, you most likely will not find this product on the grocery store shelves.  Ordering it in quantity is not a bad idea since it stores well and when you do finally make it, more than one is usually in order.

       " \" Anyone who has ever visited New Orleans will most likely have a tale to tell of a late-night or early morning visit to the world-famous Cafe Du Monde (cafe of the world) for a snack of Beignets and Chicory coffee.<br /><br />This simple little square fritter with powdered sugar is often imitated but somehow never quite the same as the cafe Du Monde version.  The authetic mix guarantees you that Cafe Du Monde taste and they are relatively easy to fry up at home for a weekend morning treat.  Traditonally fried in Cottonseed oil, most home-cooks opt for a healthier, lighter oil but anyway you fry them, these are not exactly health food!<br /><br />Essentially, Beignets are fried dough covered with generous amounts of powedered sugar.  Traditionally served by themselves on a plate a of three with cups of Chicory coffee, you can, if you want, get adventurous and fill them with fruit (cherry works best) compote or sweet cream cheese for variety. You can also set a few sugared blueberries and a sprig of mint in the middle of a plate of three beignets for a classic presentation. They are so scrumptious that you needen't really offer anything else but some folks like to include Beignets as part of a larger brunch menu.  Me, I prefer just the Beignets with their traditional beverage, for a mid-morning light brunch.  These are best if fried up in large batches for a group since frying anything in small amounts seems like too much effort for too little outcome, but one box at a time is okay too.<br /><br />While there are plenty of beignet recipes out there, this mix is super-easy and carries the Cafe Du Monde name. They turn out well and taste very much like the real thing.  It is worth the effort to make sure you also serve up some Chicory Coffee as well since it is the pairing of the two that evokes the strong memory of nights in New Orleans.  The strong taste of the Chicory compliments the simplicity of the beignets beautifully.\\n\",\n",

       " ' This tiny jar of concentrated yeast extract is quite the breakfast food. To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by \"thinly?\" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light.<br /><br />How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer\\'s Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it \"very thinly, for now.\"<br /><br />Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast \"soldiers\" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it\\'s made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.<br /><br />The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don\\'t like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.<br /><br />4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins:<br /><br />Riboflavin  0.28mg (17.5% RDA)<br />Niacin  5.4mg (35.6% RDA)<br />Folic Acid  100ug (50.0% RDA)<br />Vitamin B12  0.5ug (60.0% RDA)\\n',\n",

Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate.<br /><br />I\\'ve found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household.

       " \" I was so skeptical of this product that I had to write a review for the rest of the skeptics. This is a fabulous way to get a european coffee experience at home. I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks, I find their coffee too bitter, but like everyone else I truck over there spending close to $4.00 a cup on a specialty latte. This is different. This is like the coffee I had every morning in Provence. It has great flavor and the frothy top is something you could never get with your regular coffee maker. I love that I can do one cup at a time, so my coffee isn't sitting on the warming plate losing its flavor until I'm ready for another cup. It froths itself, so you don't have to deal with complicated and hard to clean steaming mechanisms. It takes a minute to boil the water and then less than 30 seconds to fill the cup, which is much quicker than making regular coffee. It is easy to put together, take apart and clean; in fact, when I was comparing the similar-looking Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker brands in the store I couldn't get those two models back together after I looked at the pod holder, which cinched the decision for me on the Senseo (which has a very simple press-down locking mechanism). I'm so glad!!! I haven't tried the dark roast yet, but we love the medium and the decaf, and the mild is nice for afternoon. I was worried about the cost of the pods until I realized that a bag of 18 is under $4.00, which is like 22 cents a pod. When I balance that against $1.00-$4.00 a cup to get anything remotely similar from a coffeehouse, it seems like the bargain of the century. And I don't have to change out of my pjs! If you are a coffee lover I highly recommend this wonderful, unique machine.\\n\",\n",

And while my four-pawed trio has generally taken the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that has filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has not been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not generally picky in their food choices; they willingly accept most everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???\\n\",\n",
       " ' Given this blend\\'s orgin, the name \"English\" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name \"breakfast tea.\" It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word \"English,\" which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday \"work horse,\" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.\\n',\n",
       " ' The history of soft drinks goes all the way back to the mineral water found in natural springs.  The first marketed (non-carbonated) soft drinks, made from water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, appeared in the 17th century. The first drinkable manmade glass of carbonated water was created by an Englishmen, Dr. Joseph Priestley, nine years before the Declaration of Independence.  In 1832, John Mathews invented an apparatus for making carbonated water.  The drinking of natural (or even artificial) mineral water was considered a healthy practice so American pharmacists were adding medicinal and other flavorful herbs (birch bark, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts) to unflavored beverage from their soda fountains.  Then their customers wanted to start taking the drinks home with them and thus the soft drink bottling industry was born, leading eventually to \"Rock and Roller Cola Wars.\"<br /><br />In 1893 in New Bern, North Carolina, a young pharmacist named Caleb Bradham began experimenting with a wide variety of different soft drink concoctions that friends and patrons could try out at his drugstore soda fountain.  Five year\\'s later the most popular formulation, known as \"Brad\\'s Drink,\" a combination of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils and cola nuts, is named Pepsi-Cola and in 1902 the company was incorporated.  The product was sold with the slogan: \"Exhilarating, Invigorating, Aids Digestion.\"  By 1995 the company\\'s slogan was \"Nothing else is a Pepsi.\"  PepsiCo.\\'s restaurant division, Tircon Global Restaurants, Inc., which includes Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, & KFC, is the largest restaurant company in the world in terms of units and second-largest in sales (go ahead and guess who is bigger and what cola they happen to sell).<br /><br />Here we have 144 fluid ounces of Pepsi Cola divided into a dozen 12 ounce cans as the \"6-Pack\" goes the way of the nickle bottle of Pepsi.  Today, Pepsi is a concoction of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.  The high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar part has me puzzled, simply because I would think that once a corporation has a major formula they do not mess with it in any way shape or form.  So now I am wondering if the taste difference between high fructose corn syrup based Pepsi Cola and sugar based Pepsi Cola is as significant as the difference between soda fountain Pepsi Cola and Pepsi Cola in a can (the latter is better).  In addition to the 150 calories per 12 fluid ounce serving you get the following percentage daily values (based on a 2,000 calorie diet):<br /><br />Total Fat (0g) 0%<br />Sodium (35 mg) 1%<br />Potassium (10 mg)<br />Total Carbohydrates (41 g of Sugars)  14%<br />Protein (0 g) 0%<br /><br />There is also 25 mg of caffeine, a fact that is not included in the Nutrition Facts on the side of the can, which I find interesting because I know I am not alone in drinking Pepsi for the caffeine instead of the sodium or sugars.  But I also know that I like the sweeter more refreshing taste of Pepsi as compared to the competition (Bill Cosby once dismissed the idea that we wanted cola with a \"sweeter\" taste, but he was wrong).<br /><br />When I was in England several years ago I saw a whole bunch of ad posters in which things that were traditionally red over there, such as mailboxes and phone booths, were suddenly blue.  Of course I now know this was in anticipation of Pepsi going from white cans to blue cans.  You might wonder how much money was spent to determine that blue versus red was a better marketing position than white versus red, but when you are going up against a product whose brand name has become the generic name for cola, you need to look for every marketing opportunity.<br /><br />For most of us the history of Pepsi is found not in the can (or the bottle), but the advertising slogans.  See how far back in history you can go down this trip along memory lane: \"Be Young. Have Fun. Drink Pepsi\" (1993), \"Choice of a New Generation\" (1992), \"You Got The Right One Baby\" (1990), \"The choice of a New Generation\" (1984), \"Have a Pepsi Day!\" (1976), \"Pepsi Generation\" (1962), \"Now it\\'s Pepsi, for those who think young\" (1960), \"The Light Refreshment\" (1953), \"Bigger Drink, Better Taste\" (1943), \"Drink Pepsi-Cola, it will satisfy you\" (1920), and \"The Original Food Drink\" (1906).\\n',\n",

Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November).

       " \" This review is written for Pill Pockets for Cats (Amazon ASIN:B00061MVTG). Amazon will sometimes post this review next to Greenies Pill Pockets. Unless Greenies bought Pill Pockets for Cats and has reissued it under their label, this is a mistake. I've NEVER TRIED GREENIES. I took my original 2004 review down and am reposting it with this warning.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats are soft, hollow, little cat treats. They are shaped like a cup. The concept is simple. Put the pill in the opening and then seal it by pinching it closed, then feed it to your cat. Our cat was a little hesitant the first couple times, so we would put a little catfood gravy on it (which she adores). She ate it right up. Sometimes she would get fussy and not eat it (mainly because she's an annoying, spoiled little critter), but I've found that dressing it up with dried bonito flakes works really well too. Now she looks forward to her daily treat and would remind me if she didn't get it.<br /><br />The pockets in the first bag were similar to the consistency of Velveeta, though the second bag was a little more dried out and tended to crumble. Our cat prefers the pill pockets when they are moist, but she will still eat the drier ones. I think that the product dries out as it sits on the shelf. If you are buying the product from a store (as opposed to Amazon), shake the bag. If it rattles a lot like the pieces are loose, the product is more likely to be dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Unless you have a lot of cats, I don't recommend buying the product in large quantities. After the bag is opened, the product tends to start drying out. For us, the 45-count bag was just right, by the time we got to the bottom, the pills were drier, but still moist enough for my cat to eat them without too much coaxing.<br /><br />Our veterinarian prescribed tiny tablets for our cat (cut in half), so there is plenty of room to spare. I would guess that you could probably fit a pill the size of an aspirin in there, but you might have to stretch it a bit.<br /><br />The Pill Pockets are a bit pricey (around $7 for 45 pieces), but it's so much easier than stuffing a pill down the cat's throat, that it's really worth it.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats (salmon flavor) comes in a metallic pinkish bag. The chicken flavor comes in a yellowish bag, but we've never tried it.. Pill Pockets for Cats used to come in clear plastic bags, but I think they found that opaque bags keeps the product fresh longer. Greenies comes in a green bag.\\n\",\n",

       " ' It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey\\'s milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese\\'s Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this pair of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them. Fortunately this is a 2 cup packages, because my way of eating Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups is to eat them all. Open up a wrapper with four cups, I eat four. Open up a wrapper with two cups, I eat two. You do not want to enjoy too much of a good thing when it comes to candy.\\n',\n",

       " \" It absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  Why?  Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  This mug solve the single serving dilemma.  It's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  Count those seconds.  Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  Easy.<br /><br />I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.<br /><br />Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.\\n\",\n",

       " ' Introduced to Kenya from India in 1903 by a settler named G.W.L.Caine, nowadays tea is one of Kenya\\'s major economic sectors; directly or indirectly employing roughly 10% of the country\\'s population and, at over over 180,000 tonnes per year, constituting around 10% of total global tea production or 20% of worldwide export. Kenyan tea is grown at elevations between 5,000 and 7,000 feet and generally harvested year-round. The primary growth regions are the Nandi Hills and the highlands around Kericho north of the Massai Mara Game Reserve and west of the central Kenyan Great Rift Valley, which in turn is the home of Meru National Park (of George and Joy Adamson/\"Born Free\" fame - further east near Mount Kenya) and Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen\\'s beloved Ngong Hills (in the south near Nairobi).<br /><br />Kenyan tea has small, grainy leaves and a rich color and distinct, full-bodied aroma that makes it a near ideal breakfast tea and as such, a nice alternative to the traditional English breakfast blend (which sometimes contains Kenyan teas as well).\\n',\n",
       " ' Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe\\'s original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea\\'s natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can\\'t go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: \"When the mandarin\\'s tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family\\'s long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey\\'s tea by name.\")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend\\'s particular flavor. (But that\\'s just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.\\n',\n",
       " ' Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.\\n',\n",

       " ' Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word \"mati\" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant\\'s ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion\\'s powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman\\'s faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.\\n',\n",

LOL.<br /><br />This stuff is such a big hit at my house, that I have taught my cats tricks- like to \"Sit\" on command, in exchange for this treat- that\\'s how much they love it.<br /><br />Best of all, I have a cat whose tummy gets upset easily, and she never gets sick after eating this like she did with other kinds of treats. This is 100% pure dried fish- NO fillers, which is great.<br /><br />I deducted one star because these shavings tend to turn to powder in the bottom of the jar, which makes the cats sneeze so I usually have to throw a tiny bit of it away- but it is a very small portion compared to the size of the container.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product, healthy and makes kitties VERY happy. I buy it regularly.\\n',\n",
       " ' Compared to a national franchise that has a last syllable of \"buck$\" (cheap shot, I agree), this easy-to-make mix is just as rich, but perhaps not as overtly sweet. (Plus, you don\\'t have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with \"chocolat chaud\" written on it, and you know the contents of what you\\'re drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion.<br /><br />At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you\\'ve reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C\\'est tout!<br /><br />Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron!<br /><br />OK, so it\\'s not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all,  makes a \"bowl of soul,\" a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others. It may move you, as it does me, to rhapsodic heights. Twenty servings per can, give some to your sweetie.\\n',\n",

       " ' It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey\\'s milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese\\'s Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them.\\n',\n",

       " ' I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any \"dust\" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily \"stirring\", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don\\'t dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says \"CHEMICAL FREE...\" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read \"HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE\" or \"BIOTOXIN FREE\".<br /><br />Anyway, I\\'ll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I\\'ve tried a premium litter, I\\'ll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.\\n',\n",

It\\'s a great tea for any time of the day and with any accompaniment, on its own, or with sugar or cream.<br /><br />Twinings employs the carbon dioxide method of decaffeination for their decaf teas. The tea is exposed to compressed carbon dioxide, which acts as a solvent, extracting the caffeine while leaving larger molecules unaffected. The process preserves more flavor and removes more caffeine than water process decaffeination. 97% of caffeine must be eliminated for a beverage to be called \"decaffeinated\", which would leave only a few milligrams of caffeine per cup of tea, regardless of the method.<br /><br />For a departure from plain tea, these are my favorite recipes:<br /><br />*Homemade Mint Tea*<br />This is wonderful consumed hot and incomparable served over ice in the summer: Bring about 3 quarts of water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/4 cup of sugar, and a handful of sliced fresh mint leaves to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool, then strain. It will keep a few days in the refrigerator.<br /><br />*Lemongrass Tea*<br />This has a smooth, mellow lemon flavor without the acidity of lemon tea: Bring about 3 quarts water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/3 cup powdered sugar cane juice (Sucanat, Florida Crystals, or substitute sugar), and half a stalk of lemongrass, thickly sliced, to a boil in a saucepan.

I kept debating between the Senseo and the HomeCafe.  It was a demo of the senseo that made me decide to go with it.  The Senseo brews a nice small cup of coffee that is nice and frothy.

       " ' This coffee is great!  The Senseo machine can be difficult to use as far as getting pods into it correctly.  I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting \"steam locks\" but I have had issues when:<br /><br />  - the pod is not inserted properly<br /><br />  - the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine<br /><br />  - the pod is not prepared for insertion properly<br /><br />My issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water  coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded.  This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.<br /><br />Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded \"steam lock\"), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn\\'t open.<br /><br />By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods.  If you don\\'t put it in just right, you will have problems.  The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine.  Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds).  The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to \"break up the coffee\" within the pod before using, which has the same effect.  It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups.  I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.<br /><br />During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle.  This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!<br /><br />So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.\\n',\n",

       " ' In 1923 the Milky Way bar was created with the idea of putting \"A chocolate malted milk in a candy bar\".  The original Milky Way bar was created in both chocolate and vanilla flavors, even though the latter had a dark bittersweet chocolate coating.  The name was trademarked in 1925 and sold nationally the following year for 5 cents.  In 1932 the 5-cent bar was increased to a two-piece bar and then in 1936 it went back to being a one-piece bar and the vanilla Milky Way bar was changed to the Forever Yours bar.  If you were wondering why you do not remember the Forever Yours bar that was because it was discontinued in 1979, so I would strongly advise against eating any Forever Yours bars that you might happen to find.  However, in 1989 they came out with the Milky Way Dark bar, which basically had the same ingredients as the Forever Yours bar, but you should not eat any of those either because in 2000 the Milky Way Dark Bar was renamed the Milky Way Midnight bar, because the name change along was seen as a way of increasing sales, so those you can safely eat.  Outside of the United States if you want a Milky Way bar then you just gets a Mars bar.<br /><br />A Milky Way bar is made of chocolate malt-flavored nougat and caramel covered with milk chocolate.  The nougat part is made by whipping egg whites with other ingredients until light and frothy enough to make a frappe.  That is when the cocoa and malt flavorings are added to the frappe to create the candy bar\\'s signature flavor.  As for the wiggly lines on the bottom of the bars, those come from the belt they ride on while cooling.  In 1999, in case you did not notice it, the Milky Way brand was reformulated and relaunched.  The year before they made over 200 million single size Milky Way bars produced in the United States, so they decided to change everything, from the packaging, slogan, and advertising (\"Milk it!\") to the taste.  The Milky Way bar saw a 20% increase in the caramel and the chocolate was made chunkier (however the Milky Way Dark bar that is now the Milky Way Midnight bar had its caramel increased by only 10%).  Today the slogan for Milky Way is \"Pleasure you can\\'t measure.\"<br /><br />The ingredients in a Milky Way bar are milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk, chocolate, lactose, milk fat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, skim milk, less than 2% milk fat, cocoa powder processed with alkali, lactose, malted barley, wheat flour, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.  Each Milky Way bar is 2.05 oz (58.12 g) and has 270 calories, of which 90 are calories from fat (which is not as bad as it sounds).  The product is gluten free but is only kosher certified in the Celebrations package.  The key thing here is the taste, which combines milk chocolate with creamy caramel and fluffy nougat into a pretty sweet tasting candy bar.\\n',\n",

       " ' I enjoy chewing gum, and have tried dozens of brands.  One of my favorites has been Fruit Stripe gum.  However, I have found it difficult to find Fruit Stripe gum.  The Marukawa brand offers an intense citric acid flavor and a softer chew than Fruit Stripe gum.  I think Murakawa orange is not quite as true of an orange flavor as Fruit Stripe gum, but the easier chew and more intense flavor are advantages that make this gum a good alternative.  The only other drawback is that the Murakawa gum is a bit more expensive than domestic gum.  However, consider it a novel foreign gourmet gum and give it a chance.  If you are a fan of fruit flavored gums, this one will challenge your tongue.\\n',\n",

I couldn't get enough of it- I drank 6-8 cups a day for a month.  It's just a great complement to anything that you've eaten.  I bought the Sencha Special Grade from Upton Tea, thinking it must be better than this since it's twice as expensive, but the Yamamotoyama is a shade better for my taste.  I can never go back to tea bags, especially tasteless brands like  Bigelows or Tazo.  I don't mind some black tea bags, but not the fannings they use in green tea bags.  Green tea has got to be one of the best things in life.\\n\",\n",
       " \" I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  It just didn't make sense.  Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.<br /><br />My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo.  The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  I always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough.  He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away.  So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods.  The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out.  The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried.  So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  But, that has not worked for me.<br /><br />So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands.  So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.<br /><br />I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod.  It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  It might be the next thing I try.\\n\",\n",

Kimbo Gold is genuine espresso from Napels, famed for its incomparable coffee, and uses only the best Brazillian coffee beans.  Its taste can be best described as potent with a real kick, but without any bitterness, and with a deep yet clear espresso flavour.  I prefer it to some of the better known premium brands, such as the otherwise excellent Illy caffe. Its flavour is much richer and isn't even lost in a capuccino or latte - the milk if anything seems to bring out the flavour even more.  I highly recommend this espresso to anyone who is looking for the real thing.\\n\",\n",

Adagio is one of the best brands I've tried and its prices are better than average for tea of this quality.<br /><br />Yunnan Gold is Adagio's premium grade Yunnan tea.  Its lower grade, Yunnan Jig, is quite good and very inexpensive, but Yunnan gold is fantastic.  It is an assertive tea, able to stand up nicely to milk and sugar, but it isn't the slightest bit bitter.  I have had it black and it was still tasty, but I prefer to have black teas light and sweet.  Even when I have accidentally over-steeped it (you should steep it for about 3 minutes), it was smooth and mellow.  There is a natural sweetness to this tea and very complex flavors that are spicy yet subtle.<br /><br />FYI, this is considered a black tea.  Black teas are so named, based upon how long they are allowed to ferment.  Green tea has the least fermentation, oolong has some fermentation, and black teas are allowed to reach complete fermentation.  Generally speaking the more a tea is fermented the more caffiene it contains.<br /><br />This is a perfect all day tea.  A pleasure first thing in the morning, and yet delightful all day and into the night (it has caffiene so if you have insomnia avoid drinking it and all caffiene beverages after 4 PM).  If you like bold tea, like a hearty Assam or Cylon, this tea might be too delicate for you, although I still suggest you give it a try, you might be seduced by its many virtues.\\n\",\n",

It looked the same, it smelled the same, it tasted the same.  And the Folger's is a dollar cheaper (at least, at Bed Bath and Beyond).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not above paying more if the coffee's better.  I don't really care that much.

       " ' Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.\\n',\n",

The mountain-encased and until recently not easily accessible province is probably the location of the mythical Shangri-La, referred to in James Milton\\'s \"Lost Horizons,\" as well as home to the ancient city of Lijang (a UNESCO world heritage site) in the shadow of the mighty Yulong (Jade Dragon) Snow Mountain, Bai horses, Dali marble and numerous medicinal products, including one of China\\'s famous \"wonder drugs,\" the white powder known as \"Baibao Dan\" (One Hundred Treasures Drug), which is said to cure everything from injuries to certain gynecological diseases, and frequently applied to clean open wounds and stop bleeding, stimulate blood circulation, and against inflammations.<br /><br />Tea plantation in Yunnan began about 1700 years ago, during the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279), when the city of Pu\\'erh in the South of the province became a major tea trading center; although at least in Yunnan\\'s northwestern corner the tradition is probably even older and was imported across the border from Tibet during the Tang dynasty. Elsewhere, bricks of Pu-erh tea also constituted the first medium of monetary exchange used by nomads beyond the Great Wall of China, and their use has been recorded as early as A.D. 476.<br /><br />Yunnan is a broadleaf tea with a distinctly bright color and intense, lasting, slightly peppery or spicy taste.

That aroma is created during the tea\\'s smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.<br /><br />Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long.

       " ' Some of us should be warned about two important facts about this Annie\\'s product:<br /><br />1. It is made from organic, white cheddar cheese.<br /><br />2. These are shells, not macaroni.<br /><br />Point number one is very important. Not just because the cheese is organic (organic pastuerized milk, salt, enzymes), although that is very important to some people. No, it is mentioned here because some purists will eat only YELLOW cheddar cheese. White cheddar cheese makes white cheddar cheese sauce, and together they make something to eat with the color of white cheddar cheese. Therefore, this will look white--not snow white--but a soft creamy white, and some people (who will not be mentioned here) insist on yellow. Often this is a bright, unrealistic looking yellow, almost like it\\'s radioactive, but I am not one to judge.<br /><br />The second thing to know is that the noodle-like things covered with the white cheddar cheese sauce are NOT macaroni. (As in \"stuck a feather in his hat and called it...\") These are \"shells.\" They resemble some sea shells, like the kind that Pagoo the hermit climbed into in that book, or like the rounded shells--only smaller--that you can put up to your ear and supposedly you can then hear almost anything, like even something happening in New York or France. Again, these are not macaroni, and this is important because there are some people who will eat only the little tubes known as macaroni.<br /><br />If you are OK with this, then you\\'re in luck, and you don\\'t need to look any further for a good lunch, dinner, or after play snack (or school, if you go to school). Annie\\'s is like that other big company\\'s product (Annie\\'s is number two), where you boil and drain the macaroni (although here we have shells, NOT macaroni), and then mix in the dry sauce, maybe adding some milk or butter. \"Season to taste.\"<br /><br />The actual, official, ingredients include the following:<br />Organic Durum Semolina Pasta (Organic Durum Semolina, Water), Organic White Cheddar Cheese (Organic Cultured Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Enzymes), Whey, Salt.

According to the website, Annie\\'s is available in every state, and now has \"a product line that has grown to include 13 different varieties of totally natural macaroni and cheese, Annie\\'s now makes five tasty pasta meals, four yummy canned macs, and a microwave macaroni and cheese...\" By the way, the name of the bunny on Annie\\'s products is \"Bernie.\" I learned that on the website.\\n',\n",

       " ' All successful actors have a role or a film that defines them for the rest of their careers. Tom Cruise has \"Risky Business.\" Robert De Niro has \"Taxi Driver.\" Marlon Brando had a lot of them, including \"On the Waterfront,\" \"The Godfather,\" and \"Apocalypse Now.\" Who can watch Jimmy Stewart and not think of \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\"? See what I mean? The list could on and on indefinitely. The lesser known actors, while not as visible to the majority of moviegoers, are critical to the success of Hollywood because they often take supporting roles that make the leads look good. They are recognizable faces to niche film fans, however. Enter Clint Howard, brother of the better known director and actor Ron Howard. Horror movie fans will forever pay homage to Clint--he of the perpetually balding pate, goofy visage, and lumbering gait--for his seminal role of Stanley Coopersmith in the 1982 gorefest \"Evilspeak.\" They will just as likely hold a grudge against him for appearing in Uwe Boll\\'s atrocious \"House of the Dead,\" but that\\'s another story for another time. Clint has appeared in dozens of films, as well as most of the films lensed by his brother, but \"Evilspeak\" is his defining moment.<br /><br />\"Evilspeak\" opens in the distant past by showing a group of Spaniards excommunicating Esteban (Richard Moll) and his followers from the Church for blasphemous activities. What sorts of activities? The movie doesn\\'t spend much time explaining what these folks are doing, but we do see Esteban performing some sort of bizarre ritual on the beach immediately before sacrificing a young lady to his dark deities. Flash forward to the present--meaning 1981 or 1982--to a soccer game at the West Andover Military Academy. Stanley Coopersmith (Howard) trips at a critical moment and loses the game for the team. The abuse heaped upon this poor lad is extreme. Coach (Claude Earl Jones) initially sticks up for Coopersmith by telling his teammates that every boy at the academy gets a shot at playing for the school. Within seconds of this exclamation, the coach helpfully makes a \"suggestion\" to Bubba (Don Stark) and his pals that if an injury sidelined Stanley, there wouldn\\'t be much anyone could do about it. Wow, what a bunch of jerks! This is only the beginning, however, as we soon learn that the entire school seems to have it in for this poor kid. Colonel Kincaid (Charles Tyner), the commandant of the academy, can\\'t stand him either. Neither can Reverend Jameson (Joseph Cortese) or the alcoholic caretaker Sarge (R.G. Armstrong).<br /><br />Things start to look up for Coopersmith when he discovers a labyrinth of corridors underneath the school. Wouldn\\'t you just know it? It turns out that the academy sits on the very site where Esteban and his followers established a church devoted to Satan. Stanley\\'s discovery is in actuality Esteban\\'s old haunt. Our hero finds a book written in Latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers, and it isn\\'t too long before he\\'s entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means. Meanwhile, the torment continues. Bubba and his fellow goons destroy Stanley\\'s class project, and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get. Kincaid administers a whipping, and Jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing. Coopersmith\\'s dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters. The final straw occurs when Bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing Coopersmith cares about in the entire world. From this point forward the gloves are off as \"Evilspeak\" turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions. Note to self: never pick on anyone again. EVER.<br /><br />\"Evilspeak\" never lets us forget that Clint Howard is the star of the film. The camera rarely leaves him, which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is. Howard gives his put upon character great depth, makes us believe totally that he\\'s a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life. Stanley Coopersmith is so harassed that you can\\'t help but root for him. Perhaps I should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in B movie history, and that is exactly what the script called for them to do. I cheered at the end as Coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors. Speaking of the gore, \"Evilspeak\" contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in American horror films. The pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award, but the real gooey stuff appears at the end. Imagine an airborne Clint Howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword. Yep, it\\'s gory, it\\'s gluey, and it\\'s great.<br /><br />A huge thanks goes out to Anchor Bay for releasing such a fine DVD version of the film. Extras include a commentary with Howard and director Eric Weston, poster stills, and a trailer. The commentary is a lot of fun due to Clint Howard\\'s observations. He tells lots of great stories, including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a Las Vegas casino several years later. Clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine. Weston and Howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel! It probably won\\'t happen, but if it matches this film in the gore department I\\'ll be the first one in line to see it.\\n',\n",

To igourmet's credit, they apologized and gave me a full refund, so I don't blame then. I've since read that the cheese is fragile and very hard to find in its best state, even in Italy.

       " \" I just finished watching this train wreck and I had to warn anyone who's considering buying this to stay far far away. I read every review just like you're doing now, looking for something different and was fooled into thinking this film would be something special. After viewing this I was left disappointed and frustrated. I have one question for all the glowing reviewers...What the hell were you watching??  It's not quality moviemaking! The script was weak, the plot was dragged out way too long, it took 52 minutes before anyone was killed. Factor in a poor musical score and sound transfer, topped off by sub-par to mediocre acting and you have an amatuer film. As far as special effects go, just fast forward to the last 15 minutes for what little this movie this has offer. This movie reminds me of a college student film gone wrong. To put it bluntly, if this film scared you, you're a P@$$Y! If Amazon offered this for free and just charged you shipping, you paid too much. Go check out something else.\\n\",\n",

       " \" First: to review the contents. Kookaburra is an insanely delicious licorice--the flavor can only be compared to dark, dark chocolate. Ordinary domestic licorice you may have eaten in the past is a pale, anise-flavored ersatz shadow compared to this. If you remember how licorice tasted years and years ago, this is it. Kookaburra actually HAS licorice root in it; American licorice uses cheap anise oil and thus has barely any real flavor.  Warning; if you tend to high blood pressure, excessive real licorice can be bad for you--causes water retention. Aside from that I can't think of a reason not to enjoy this treat.<br /><br />My only complain is that the price for 10 oz. is a bit steep. This is one of the best licorice out there, however, and for a real addict of this herbal treat, there is nothing like it.\\n\",\n",

Haribo, that German maker of gummis, makes a fine licorice wheel or snail; you unroll the licorice into a long whip or else you can bite into the wheel like a cake if you are not prone to play with your candy or blow bubbles with your gum.

It gives the stew a very rich, delicious flavor. The flavor of the carrots, potatoes, and peas in the stew really seem to pop, and the beef acquires a delicious taste. My kids love my beef stew.\\n',\n",
       " \" This is my favorite cheese.  It is particularly tasty when sharing each bite of cheese with a pretzel stick or two in the same mouthful.<br /><br />When I lived on the mainland, I would routinely buy Tiger Swiss Gruyere on almost every other grocery trip.  If you like high quality cheese, try to find this in your supermarket in the highly visible yellow round pack, with 6 foil-wrapped wedges.  The assorted flavors are also good, but I just prefer the plain variety.<br /><br />When I moved to Hawaii, I just couldn't find it in any local store. Bummer!  I now have to pay almost as much for shipping as the product itself. By mail order, it comes shrink-wrapped as 6 yellow round packs of 6 wedges each.  (You don't have to refrigerate it, and it tastes better at room temp.)<br /><br />My only complaint -- the mail order wedges are skinny 2/3 oz each, 4 oz per round, 24 oz per 6-round package.  The supermarket wedge is one oz each, 6 oz per round.  Watch out if you look at photos, since they incorrectly photograph the larger 6 oz rounds.<br /><br />I bought 2 packages (12 rounds) on Thanksgiving and ran out today. I just placed another order. Why would anyone pay $40 for 3 pounds of cheese? Because I can't find it any cheaper here, and save a LOT on shipping by buying two at a time.  If your supermarket carries it, it should be about half that -- you don't have to pay shipping you lucky dog!\\n\",\n",

       " ' I used to make a Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait on the stove with milk, melted chocolate, coffee, sugar, and seasonings. It was a delicious flavorful alternative to equally delicious homemade hot cocoa for special occasions. I have never been satisfied with easy or \"instant\" methods of making plain hot cocoa. They just can\\'t compete with the richness of heavy cream and melted chocolate. But my Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait met its match in Ghirardelli\\'s Chocolate Mocha. This is a wonderful powdered mix of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.<br /><br />The instructions tell you to mix 3 tablespoons of Ghirardelli\\'s Chocolate Mocha with 8 oz (1 cup) of milk, heat, and serve. I find that 2 tablespoons with 2/3 cup of milk fills the average cup or mug. And I always use half-and-half instead of milk. Topped with sweetened whipped cream, this makes a decadent, filling dessert that rivals homemade and restaurant beverages and is attractive enough to serve to guests. Serve with a spoon for those who like to eat the whipped cream before it all melts into the chocolate.<br /><br />Ghirardelli provides microwave and stovetop directions. The microwave instructions advise heating the milk for 1-1 1/2 minutes before adding the Chocolate Mocha mix. I don\\'t think the 2-step process is necessary, but if you\\'ve ever tried to heat milk or half-and-half in a microwave, you know how quickly it can get out of hand. One second nothing is happening; the next second the milk has bubbled all over the floor of your oven, leaving little in the cup. If you want to heat the hot chocolate in the microwave, you can add the Chocolate Mocha mix before you heat the milk, but don\\'t take your eyes off of it once you start heating. If you see any bubbles, stop the microwave immediately, stir the drink, and heat more as necessary. Keep doing that until it\\'s hot enough for you.\\n',\n",

Oh, but the FDA does not allow it to be called a \"sweetener\" it has to be labeled a \"nutritional suppliment\" by law so that it can not compete with big money contributers Aspartame (equal) and Sucralose (splenda) and Acesulfame-K so although Stevia is safe and has been used for thousands of years in other countries (even was in Diet Coke in Japan) the only problem the FDA has, is that it can not be called a sweetener!<br /><br />Please don\\'t take my word for anything I have just said above, please do the research yourself so you KNOW it is all the truth.\\n',\n",

You should not count on any products to help lose weight;cutting back on: fast foods,fried products, late night eating and over indulging are some of the keys along with drinking plenty of water,physical activities (walking through local museums)get off your BUM!!! these are key factors. Just because the economy is'nt doing well does'nt mean we have to. Depression is a key factor to weight gain. Thank Jesus every day any how. Don't let the devil take you out with diabetes,lung disease and other health problems associated with weight gain. Take back your life.

       " ' For the Holidays last year, I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighter/healthier. I\\'m familiar with Jell-O\\'s No Bake line, such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake, so I figured their Pumpkin Pie (style) mix should be good too. Well, it\\'s not. At first taste, I thought \"that\\'s not bad!\", but after a few mouthfuls of it, I could barely stand it anymore. There are two main problems I find with it. First of all, the consistency is off, it doesn\\'t really get to a Pie consistency, more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned. I\\'ve added less milk (1.5 cups) and that helped a bit with the texture (now more like thicker pudding). Second, in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin, Kraft put wayy too much ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg or whatever else in there. The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls. So now I\\'m stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it and/or get rid of it.  At the very least, I could use the included crust mixes for another one of Jell-O\\'s better flavors.\\n',\n",
       " ' These taste just like the Oreo Golden cookies.  We love vanilla sandwich cookies and were looking for healthier choice.  These organic cookies are just the perfect solution.  Healthier (than cookies with unnameable ingredients) and delicious!\\n',\n",

I prefer letting the noodles sit for a few minutes after adding the spices so it's not so wet when I eat it but that's only because when I make yakisoba, I like it a little dry and crunchy.\\n\",\n",

       " ' Dog loves the treats, will keep using Greenies from Amazon they seem better for teeth cleaning.  This large container will last a long time and was a fair value, better price through Amazon than local store.\\n',\n",
       " ' Small and soft enough for a quick reward when training my puppy. It doesn\\'t hurt that she also loves them. They do smell strong but nothing worse than typical dog food, plus the odor keeps her attention. The only downside (if you would call it that) is that they are a little on the \"oily\" side. Just a tad but enough to keep a lingering smell if you don\\'t wash your hands right away, which I would do any way so really is no big deal.\\n',\n",
       " ' I bought these over a year ago on the recommendation of a dog trainer. I had tried several others, all of which were OK.  These are the most strong-smelling and apparently tasting treats I have ever seen, and our Lab really responded to them.  You do have to keep them in a sealed container or they will dry out.  They are a bit expensive compared to some others, but  I found that I could cut them in half and get the same effect when using for training (and save a few bucks).\\n',\n",

I used 12 in about 15-18 days.<br /><br />I loved the flavor: a nice, rich cup when set on medium setting on my Keurig (which is what I always use except for some weak flavored blends). They fit perfectly in my B70 Keurig -- and I love saving on extra packaging.<br /><br />But I had a problem I don't see anyone else mentioning: Of the 36 cups total, 3 were duds. The water flowed them, but only light brown water came out. Three out of 36 is too high a failure rate for me. With regular k-cups (of which I've used at least 1200 in 5 years), I've only had maybe 5 duds.<br /><br />Therefore I rate this as 3-stars for now (not less as I don't see anyone else having had this problem).

       " \" I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night, and I have suffered from migraines for most of my life. This product seemed like the perfect solution to both problems.<br /><br />For the sleep issue, I have never found anything that even comes close. I actually fell asleep, shortly after going to bed, with ease. This was really an incredible change for the better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I discovered that my migraines got worse when I was taking this. Not just a little bit worse, MUCH worse. It was as if the worst part of the migraine got extended much longer than normal. It was to the point that I had to be driven home from work and ended up in the ER in one case while I was taking this (the normal dose recommended on the label). This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed. I tried this on and off for several weeks, but unfortunately it consistently aggravated my headaches the next day anytime I took it.<br /><br />I've noticed other forms of Magnesium also cause headache issues for me, which is odd since it is supposed to help prevent them. So, hopefully this reaction is fairly individual to me. But the lack of much of any negative reviews for this product compelled me to write a review. Evidently, not everybody reacts well to it (but I do really, really wish I could take it for the sleep benefit.)\\n\",\n",

Over the past 14 months, I have had Gevalia\\'s 12-oz. \"Morning Roast\" for Tassimo several times, and purchased it from Wal-Mart, the local grocery, Kohl\\'s and even once through Tassimo Direct.  Not only was it metallic-tasting weak coffee every single time, but about 30% of the T-discs end up clogging about halfway through the brew cycle, and when they finally let loose, almost all of the grounds come squirting out into my coffee cup, ruining it anyway.  This is not a brewer problem (have cleaned and de-scaled both of my brewers), nor a water problem, as I use bottled water for coffee.  The worst part is that when you try to get any satisfaction from Tassimo, or even try to report that there\\'s a problem with these particular discs, their idiot customer service people just want to refer you to the espresso disc recall!  I will not buy any more Gevalia branded coffee.\\n',\n",

Just like the old fashioned flavors of Kool Aid, you'll have to use your imagination to think you're drinking something tasting like the actual flavor it is supposed to be. With that being said, it isn't bad. If you like sugary soft drinks, it tastes pleasant. It's loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and artificial colorings. A health drink it is obviously not, but it is no worse than any other sugar or high fructose corn syrup soft drink.\\n\",\n",

I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.

It has the same calories and sugar content as Country Time lemonade, but while Country Time only has Vitamin C, this Kool-Aid has added C and E, for what that\\'s worth.  Instead of the jar containing a scoop, the lid is a large measuring cup with lines for 1 or 2 quarts and you pour in the mix from the jar, much less messy than scooping. There\\'s a little powder \"cloud\" but it dissolves easily.<br /><br />Kids and I both liked it. I felt there was a more mango flavor than peach, which gets points from me because artificial peach flavoring can be pretty bad. In fact, I bet they could sell this as just \"mango\" flavor.\\n',\n",

I have tried some of the flavored coconut waters and they are much better.  Unless you already enjoy basic coconut water, I would recommend trying a flavored version instead.

Oh she said you do know we are replacing our kitchen units soon, oh I said, well have no fear it came with screws as well, thank you.

Unfortunately I have to rate this 4 stars as one of the boxes I received was filled with English Breakfast Tea instead of Earl Grey.

She agreed it was the loudest coffee maker she\\'d ever heard, but after a conversation w / a supervisor told me that the machine was performing as designed. Since I was within the 30 day window, I returned the machine and replaced it with an Elite model. Keurig was good about the whole thing, even sending me coupons for enough k-cups to offset the return shipping. I suggested that they make a note in the product description about the above-average sound level, but I doubt that happened.<br />  If you\\'re planning to use this machine in an environment that is naturally loud, it might be a fit, but in any kind of a situation where a normal level of sound is expected, the OfficePro, while producing a good cup of coffee in a timely manner, is, IMHO way too noisy.\\n',\n",

They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours.\\n',\n",

When made according to the package directions the flavor is weak.  I added a little extra powder to my glass and while it did strengthen the flavor to what I thought it should be, it still just wasn't that appealing to me, it still tasted a bit blah unlike favorite Kool Aid flavors such as cherry and grape.<br /><br />If you're looking for something different or more mild perhaps you'll like this, but overall it's not something I would recommend if you're looking for traditional Kool Aid taste.\\n\",\n",

On the side of box it states that \"Female Toners supports female systems by combining herbs to support healthy menstruation, purify blood and to strengthen and tone the uterus\". While I did not notice too much difference in my cycles (probably because I did not take long enough), I definitely noticed the uterine toning. My uterus would contract, giving a very uncomfortable feeling. I know what it feels like as I\\'ve had 3 children.

I called the 800 number for Traditional Medicinals to ask if this was normal, but they didn\\'t seem to know.

It has enough for two servings if you're doing a soup-and-sandwich type thing, but it's large enough for one good meal sized portion if that's all your having.<br /><br />You should note, though, that the container says specifically NOT to microwave the soup in the container.

Though I believe beef is the more traditional choice, I actually preferred this sauce on boneless, skinless chicken breasts.<br /><br />I have had Rendang curry in a few restaurants and found this kit to be close to restaurant quality.  My major complaint is that instead of using coconut milk this uses dehydrated coconut in a separate pouch, and the resulting curry sauce has a little bit of a gritty consistency because of this.  My only other issue is the amount of oil in the curry mix.  If you have leftovers (like I did), you'll definitely notice the oil since some of it separates out during refrigeration.  While the nutritional information here and on the box make it seem like this product isn't that decadent, the serving sized used is unrealistically small.  It's more reasonable to double the values listed, meaning that each serving of meat will have an additional 200+ calories from the sauce.  Because of this, I would suggest that this makes a better treat for a rare occasion than something to be eaten frequently.\\n\",\n",

If sweet potatoes aren't your thing, these probably won't sway you (they didn't for me).\\n\",\n",

       " \" We have fed Holistic Select for 5yrs now - from the time our Great Danes were puppies.  Most Great Danes I see are either a little thin or a little heavy.  Ours are just right - filled out in the right places with a terrific waistline.<br /><br />We feed our Danes from 5-7 cups of food each per day, combined with a 1/2 can each of Holistic Select canned food.  This combination adds moisture content to their meals which reduces the amount of water they need to consume with their meals and helps to keep away the dreaded bloat.<br /><br />Holistic Select helps promote joint health with Glucosamine and Chondrotin, as well as keep their coats shiny.  If you check the Whole Dog Journal (the discerning dog owners resource for dog food ratings, Holistic Select makes their list).  I would recommend this food to any dog owner - which version you use depends on your dog.  If you have a Great Dane or Large Breed dog, I would recommend no other food.  If you are going to switch your dog's food, do it gradually over a couple of weeks and try using Holistic Select Transition powder which will help your dog maintain a balanced intestinal tract during the food transition.\\n\",\n",

I have used and continue to use Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' option for all of the Orgain shakes, as I drink them at least four to five times per week and don't have to worry about searching for them all over town. In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal. Which is obviously, not as healthy for you.<br /><br />Currently, I switch between drinking the Cafe Mocha and Chocolate Fudge and would highly recommend this product. For those like myself, who work in an office setting, these are a great option to keep in the work fridge, in order to steer clear of that office snacking area (the vending machine, that co-worker who loves to bake, the Friday doughnut day, etc.).\\n\",\n",

Looking at the box in the picture, it's not even 1/3 of the way full when you take the paper out of it and see just how much candy you're actually getting.<br /><br />Three stars for the idea of it - it definitely makes a great gift, but honestly you could assemble something like this on your own for about 1/4 the price.

But over the ensuing decades, my preference has gradually drifted to teas with less (theobromines) kick -- to especially the Keemun, Oolongs, and green gunpowders.<br /><br />Over those years, I bought all my loose leaf teas from Murchies in Canada.

With the factory set position, the bigger gopher will be choked, while the little one will be crushed at the mid section.  The key to successfully use this trap is how to set it.  You have to think like a gopher, and construct this unit into the gopher's existing tunnel.  Then, leave a little opening a bit further down the tunnel.  Gophers' instinct will be to close the opening further down the tunnel, thus activate the trigger.  I have caught gophers 3 hours after the traps were set.  2 from 1 trap in the same day.<br /><br />If you are afraid to dig a big hole in your yard, this is not a unit for you as it requires some space to construct an elaborate trap.

       " ' These old-fashioned chocolate wafer cookies are the key ingredient in many recipes. Even Martha Stewart uses them on her show as the bottom of her Ice-cream Bon-Bons. In my family, they are used as the key ingredient in what is often called \"Ice-Box Cake\" or refrigerator cake which is layered chocolate wafers between some type of creamy filling such as sweetened marscapone cheese or cool-whip type preparation. For additional \"oomph\" you can crumble them on top of the pan of \"cake\" for decoration.  If you have any of the classic Martha Stewart Cookbooks or follow the new trends in Food Design through fancy cupcake books or Family Fun Magazine , you\\'ll fiind these wafers mentioned with great frequency as an essential ingredient.  One can also modify the basic Ice-Box cake recipe that this Wafer is famous for  and add cocoa to the whipping cream to create an inexpensive and alternative Bûche de Noël Dessert centerpiece (the traditional French Yule Log cake) for the holidays without having to bake a jelly roll cake and hope that it doesn\\'t break as you roll it up!  I admit, I\\'ve done that myself at least twice and recieved nothing but compliments.  All you have to do is add some chocolate mushrooms & some Marzipan or Fondant forest creatures  to the scene and you\\'re all set!<br /><br />These wafers are becoming harder and harder to find in grocery stores so most bakers order them by the case, as they are offered here,  since they keep well on the shelf and are so versatile. You can make simple icre-crem sandwiches with them by smoothing softened ice-cream between them or you can dress them up by then enrobing them in melted chocolate. They also jazz up any dessert as a simple decoration. In short...if you cook, bake or assemble desserts, you must have some of these in your pantry.<br /><br />The price here may seem a little steep but you are buying 12 packages which may be more than an average household will likely use in a year. However,  since these wonderful recipe basic cookie wafers are at the heart of so many family favorite desserts, I would suggest splitting an order with one other baker in your family since even the occasional baker could easily go thru 6 boxes in a year just by making a few recipes and snacking. By splitting a case order with a friend or family member, you each have what you need on hand for gatherings when an Ice-Box Cake is just the thing everyone needs to celebrate or if you are hoping to add a little ZING to a cupcake or Muffin recipe by placing one of these wafers at the bottom.  Incidentally, the Icebox Cake recipe is featured on the package and the photo show depiicts what it looks like when made in the traditional manner.  Ask around and once you mention the Ice-Box Cake, I\\'m sure you\\'ll find a baking friend  who is very willing to split a case with you!\\n',\n",

Sprouts are also a great source of fiber, and antioxidants. During the winter it is great to be able to grow a fresh, live food, because veggies at the grocery store are usually quite wilted or picked well before their peak. Sprouts, eaten fresh, are a plant that on a per-size basis, is pretty much the most potent and healthy thing you can feed yourself.\\n\",\n",

The level of sweetness is medium to high but well balanced with the chocolate so it's not cloying or grainy,  like a really good Godiva truffle. These have a texture halfway between fudgy and cake-like, both dense and moist. The chips add a subtle bit of extra something that is gooey and delicious when warm and adds a tiny bit of creamy crunch when they are cold.

You can use a lot of different types of juice and consequently have a lot of options for the type of drink you want. I also found that after about 6 days the fermentation levels off and the drink can not become any more alcoholic, I assume because of the lack of available sugar for the yeast to convert. Anyway, at this point it doesnt exactly taste the best. Its not too bad but if you are going for taste only leave it go for maybe 4 days.<br /><br />Not only would I recommend this to a friends, I actually have, and because it came in a two pack I was able to let them try it while I made my own.\\n',\n",

Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this  salt, so I will purchase a different brand.\\n\",\n",

       " \" What can I say? Orgain is the best protein shake I've ever had, and I've tried many of them over the years. Out of the three flavors, this newest flavor is definitely the best. I have used and continue to use Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' option for all of the Orgain shakes, as I drink them at least four to five times per week and don't have to worry about searching for them all over town. In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal. Which is obviously, not as healthy for you.<br /><br />Currently, I switch between drinking the Cafe Mocha and Chocolate Fudge and would highly recommend this product. For those like myself, who work in an office setting, these are a great option to keep in the work fridge, in order to steer clear of that office snacking area (the vending machine, that co-worker who loves to bake, the Friday doughnut day, etc.).\\n\",\n",

I recently bought this candy, and first was amazed at how large these are, and secondly how beautiful these are. If you hold up these candies to the light, you can see through them. The texture is more chewy than Haribo as well, but the taste is missing something. More than anything, these gummy bears have a sweet tarty (not like Sweet tarts, just sweet and tarty, and a mild flavor) taste. I noticed that these are getting generally great reviews, and I wish I could have had the same experience. Overall, I like the price on these, as they are reasonably priced, but I prefer Haribo.<br /><br />*** on a side note, the purple ones (I\\'m guessing grape) tastes the best, although my pack had mostly orange and red. The purples had a nice flavor, and I\\'d rate the purple as a 5 star product, although IN MY OPINION, the others weren\\'t as good.<br /><br />*** on another side note, I gave this gummy candy to others, and many of them actually said that this was better than the Haribo, and they liked the fact that this was chewier. so, just because it isn\\'t to my liking doesn\\'t mean that this isn\\'t a five star product. it\\'s all a matter of preference I guess.\\n',\n",

But then I decided to go for it, since I'm always up for trying a new coffee, regardless of price, if it's really something spectacular.<br /><br />I received the coffee promptly, and loaded the beans into my high-end burr grinder.  I then brewed the grounds in a french press.  I expected something pretty amazing, or at least an above-average coffee.  Unfortunately, I found neither in this bag.<br /><br />Though I hate to say it, I'd put this coffee on par with Folgers, or some other budget American brand.  It completely lacks flavor...  It's very mild across the whole spectrum, and even lacks body/mouthfeel.  Simply put, it tastes about like cheap diner coffee that's been sitting on a burner for a while.  Really, really disappointing.<br /><br />The only reason I can come up with for the high price is that the quantity is quite high; the bag is enormous (2.2 pounds).  Unfortunately, the quality is exponentially lower.  It's a shame, too; given that British Columbia is so close to Seattle (a place that prides itself on excellent coffee), I expected this to be a great one.  Unless you really need a (giant) cool looking coffee bag design, I'd avoid this one.\\n\",\n",

Real thick solution now::::::::Read below original comment.<br /><br />The 3 pack of Dove for Men Liquid Soap was opened already and was far more liquidy then the store bought brand. Normally this soap is much thicker, but the soap available on Amazon seems to have a thinner viscosity(like someone added water to it). It's like someone took 1-2 bottles and added water to them to make them fit into 3 bottles. The 3 pack I received had Skotch clear tape holding the lids on and I believe if this wasn't on the thin formula that Amazon provides of this Soap would more than likely leak out if this wasn't done. This soap isn't cheap and the 3 pack sounds like a deal, but when you get it you'll realize why. By buying it on Amazon you save some money, but your getting screwed since the soap is not the original Dove for Men formula, but instead a much more watered down version of this soap. A real disappointment!<br /><br />:::::UPDATE::: After running out of the water downed Dove for Men 3 pack I had, I decided to give Amazon one more try.  Since a year has passed and the price is amazing, I figured I'd see if the solution was still a problem and I can gladly say it's now the real thing. The Dove for Men solution they are now using is the same thick solution you can find in stores. Thanks for fixing this Amazon.\\n\",\n",

If you don't want to add PB to the Chocolate PB flavor, try softening at room temp rather than in the microwave, as it does slightly change the flavor and denatures the whey protein.<br /><br />I make a mini meal out if sometimes by stirring in some organic plain, nonfat greek yogurt like Stonyfield, to add protein and creaminess to it! Yumminess!!<br />However, I most often eat a serving in a little ice cream dish with a sprinkle of ginger, nutmeg or some chia seeds or berries.<br /><br />I was just amazed at how many people find the taste lacking and amused that one person accused others of working for the company because their opinions differed from hers. I believe I know why such a wide range of opinions here:<br /><br />Depends upon the condition of your palate and sensitivity of your taste buds.<br />Some people are supertasters, other not. However there are environmental factors. The more sweet and processed foods you eat, the more dull your taste buds become, craving more sweet and processed flavors, because you've conditioned your taste buds accordingly.<br /><br />Usually, the cleaner your diet, the more sensitive your taste buds will become. I see this often with my patients who give up soda (especially diet soda), and they report having less sugar cravings from just that switch.<br /><br />Also, as people age, their taste buds also grow duller/weaker. This is why seniors often love very rich/sweet foods, because their taste buds can pick up some of the taste, whereas blander foods are harder for them to taste.<br /><br />Love Arctic Zero.

       " \" Firstly, I do drink a fair amount of coffee during the winter months.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I tend not to drink flavored coffee.  This is ground, flavored coffee.  Starbucks has not previously offered flavored coffees themselves because they know it will contaminate unflavored coffee in a grinder.  They are getting around this by only selling the coffee pre-ground, therefore, no customer will ever request it to be ground.<br /><br />When first opened, the quality is decent despite being pre-ground.  However, I do find, the quality of the product slips away fairly quickly being a ground coffee.<br /><br />Furthermore, again, I am not a particular fan of flavored coffees.  If I need a sweetener or flavor, I'd prefer to add it myself.  Nevertheless, this  vanilla flavored product is not terribly unpleasant.

As far as taste, it is creamy tasting yet very plain/neutral which is good on a number of levels: I can sweeten to taste - for instance with coffee or tea I prefer to use a little agave. In recipes that are savory calling for milk I don't have to worry about altering the flavor towards sweet.<br /><br />These aseptic packages are handy to keep in the pantry so you never run out; they can keep for months at a time.

When I was sifting through it, I noticed how fresh it looked, even dried, and the smell was wonderful. I mixed it in with the eucalyptus from the same company (and same great quality) and put that with the flax in the bag. It didn't take much to make it smell good (about a tablespoon of each per cup of flax). After being used again and again in the microwave, it still smells like it did the first day. I'm very pleased with the quality, and plan on buying only this brand in the future.<br /><br />Even the room I store it in smells fabulous.<br /><br />If looking for the same great mix, I recommend both herbs from Frontier.\\n\",\n",

That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt.

In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal.

Normally this soap is much thicker, but the soap available on Amazon seems to have a thinner viscosity(like someone added water to it). It's like someone took 1-2 bottles and added water to them to make them fit into 3 bottles. The 3 pack I received had Skotch clear tape holding the lids on and I believe if this wasn't on the thin formula that Amazon provides of this Soap would more than likely leak out if this wasn't done. This soap isn't cheap and the 3 pack sounds like a deal, but when you get it you'll realize why. By buying it on Amazon you save some money, but your getting screwed since the soap is not the original Dove for Men formula, but instead a much more watered down version of this soap. A real disappointment!<br /><br />:::::UPDATE::: After running out of the water downed Dove for Men 3 pack I had, I decided to give Amazon one more try.  Since a year has passed and the price is amazing, I figured I'd see if the solution was still a problem and I can gladly say it's now the real thing. The Dove for Men solution they are now using is the same thick solution you can find in stores. Thanks for fixing this Amazon.\\n\",\n",

It is like when you go to a restaurant and they convince you to try some mystery sauce, and it's amazing, and you beg for the recipe and they won't give it to you. Maybe it's because it's made from real milk, garlic and onion, and not soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup and all that other shite the big brands use. Five stars.\\n\",\n",

       " \" I'm not worried about my fat intake at all, but I love peanut butter and would easily eat 400 peanut butter calories daily.  I'll eat a spoonful by itself, put a couple in a smoothie...  With the same amount of PB2, I'm eating 90 calories.  That means I can dip apple slices & dark chocolate, eat spoonfuls, and still put some powder in my smoothie without gaining 2 pounds a month.<br /><br />I bought one bag of chocolate and one of regular and mixed them together (thinking if it was nasty, the chocolate would help it taste better).  It actually tastes really good! My boyfriend says he can't tell that it's not regular peanut butter (I can tell) and that he prefers the powder to real peanut butter in shakes and smoothies. (I make fake ice-cream all the time by blending ice, almond milk, banana, and pb2).<br /><br />Honestly, the powder doesn't taste the same. However, it is close enough to make me keep eating it instead of the real peanut butter in the cupboard.  I like that I can make it as creamy or as thick as I want, and I have to say ignore the picture that someone posted here, because it really doesn't look that nasty!<br /><br />I took a chance buying the larger bags because it's cheaper by weight, and I am not at all disappointed.

And since I have a love hate relationship with pomegranate flavored things, I could be a little biased as well.  Sometimes they\\'re fantastic, some times they\\'re fairly lackluster.<br /><br />Pomegranate Blue is a flavored juice made from Pomegranates and Blueberries.  And it tastes most strongly of Pomegranates rather than the blueberries.  In fact, I didn\\'t really taste the blueberries at all.  The pomegranate too was kind of muted, and this drink tasted like a watered down version of fruit juice.  It wasn\\'t very sweet, which actually was ok because the bottle advertised that it was \"just a tad sweet\" so it lived up to that expectation.  Someone looking for a sugary kool-aid type product is probably not going to be fond of the taste of this product.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy, which is good because that is what the Honest brand is known for.  It was a little disappointing that the juice is from concentrate, but at least its a healthier concentrate.  And a good portion of the ingredients were organic as well, which is always a plus.  The sweetener is organic cane sugar, so no nasty artificial sweeteners here.  Although I am a bit surprised that they didn\\'t go for stevia in this drink.  And for those watching their diets, there\\'s only a 100 calories in a 16.9 fl oz bottle.  For the juices, I was surprised to see that grape juice had a higher content than the pomegranate and blueberry juices, which was kind of disappointing since the name of the drink is Pomegranate Blue.<br /><br />Not a bad drink, but not one I\\'d seek out again either.  I\\'ll keep giving the Honest brand a try, and hope that I run into a flavor I like.  They have good ingredients, but not so great taste most of the time.<br /><br />Review by M.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!\\n\",\n",

Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!\\n\",\n",

What a fun experience!<br /><br />Here\\'s what we found:<br /><br />- Grapefruits are absolutely amazing.

They did affect my nasal passages, however. :)<br />- Salsa tastes bizarre.  The tomatoes come out extremely sweet and \"take over\" for the other notes in the salsa.<br />- Beer tastes less bitter and tequila tastes less pungent.  Because the berries alter the tongue, you still get the raw effects of alcohol on your throat, etc.<br />- Pickles tasted fruitier.<br />- Tabasco sauce tasted sweet and less hot.  Similar with alcohol -- you still know you\\'re consuming something harsh!<br />- Raw sugar tasted like ... weird sugar.  Maybe smoother.  Hard to explain.  :)<br />- The berries themselves didn\\'t cause any reaction or stomach discomfort for us.  However, beware of the odd mixture of foods you try, your belly might not like such a harsh combination of acids. :)<br /><br />Here\\'s what we recommend:<br /><br />- The berries are actually very tiny (maybe the size of a large raisin), and you definitely want to be delicate when pullling the pulp off of the large (in proportion) seeds.<br />- Use Granny Smith apples as a \"palate cleanser\" between trying different things.

So I\\'ve sought out those flavor packets that have natural sweeteners, and the Pure brand by Crystal Light is one of those.<br /><br />Crystal Light Pure uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners.  So it ranks pretty high in my book in terms of ingredients.  Sure there\\'s a few hard to pronounce ingredients in the list, but it is a relatively small list compared to a lot of things anymore, and its still better than soda.  It also contains natural sugar, which is ok to me too, even if it is the first listed ingredient.  I do like that they used purple carrot and hibiscus flower extracts for color, instead of using an artificial dye.  Because I worried about that when I first saw the dark purple color the water turned after adding the powder.  Although it was a pretty color.<br /><br />The flavor, to be honest, kind of tasted like that fake grape flavor they have in candy.  It was recognizable as grape, but not the taste of \"real\" grapes.  Even though it had natural flavor in it.  But it was still good.  And the flavor was strong when adding to a regular sized bottle of water.  I prefer my drinks stronger though so that was perfectly to my liking, those who don\\'t will probably only need half a packet to flavor their water.<br /><br />I\\'d buy these again.

Mushrooms do not come in the packet. You will need to buy and slice about 1/4 pound of fresh or a small can. First, I fried some chicken. After removing the meat from the pan I added 1/2 stick butter. If I didn't have the drippings, I would have used a whole stick. In addition to mushrooms, I added sliced onions. Saute the vegetables in the butter. Add the water, then the sauce packet. Stir with a whisk or spatula until the sauce thickens, which is fairly quickly. Remove from the heat and let the sauce set for few minutes to continue thickening. I served this with Thai jasmine rice. I will try adding bell peppers the next time for a colorful variety. In German restaurants this is usually served with pan-fried pork cutlets. You can eat this with any meat cooked any way you like. Or, no meat at all, just rice or potatoes. If you are watching your fat intake, this may not be a good sauce for you unless you substitute the butter for a cholestrol-free margerine or spread. I prefer I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.

One easy-to-snap-closed container makes 24 servings, although those of us who use 3 or more \"squirts\" per glass of water may only have 15-16 servings available per bottle, at the cost of about 35 cents per glass. Still, not a bad deal, comparatively.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed. Although MIO peach does have a somewhat peachy taste that is not altogether unpleasant, it is a bit sickly sweet and altogether too chemically flavored. Whereas vitamin water zero contains mostly natural fruit ingredients and 100% of a day\\'s requirements for vitamin C, B6 and B12, MIO water enhancer has no nutritional value and is loaded with more chemicals.<br /><br />Its label lists its ingredients as: malic acid, propylene glycol, citric acid, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, potassium citrate red 40, yellow 5, blue 1 (whatever that means), and potassium sorbate.<br /><br />Whereas vitamin water zero contains the no-calorie natural sweetener stevia, MIO peach\\'s ingredients include the more questionable sucralose (also known as splenda), approved by the FDA but containing chlorine and believed by some medical authorities (such as Dr. Janet Hull) to be risky in regard to cancer, diseases of the thymus gland, and weight gain.<br /><br />A less expensive, also portable and more nutritious alternative to MIO water enhancers is to carry around wrapped sections of lemons which can easily flavor water, are tasty, natural and rich in vitamin c. Or at restaurants or cafes, simply ask for a slice of lemon with your drinking water. It will be more appealing to your taste buds and better for your body than artificial, chemically-based alternatives.\\n',\n",

It did not resemble tea and had the appearance of jello.<br /><br />Ease of use:  I found this product to be burdensome.  It is messy and I would never let a young child use this product.  The product cannot be squirted at even a slight angle because it will splatter - clothes, the floor, hands - and stain.  I was so disgusted when I first used this product and some of the product splattered onto my white vinyl floor and left huge stains.  I had to scrub the floor multiple times for the MIO stains to fade.<br /><br />Health impact:  I tried drinking this stuff twice and on both occasions I developed headaches.  I do develop migraines after consumption of certain foods and beverages but usually the food/beverage culprits contain caffeine or chocolate.<br /><br />Packaging: MIO is packaged in a #7 plastic. #7 plastics are the most difficult type of plastic to recycle. Unless you live in a really progressive place that accepts #7 plastics, the product packaging will have to be pitched.<br /><br />In sum, I cannot recommend MIO.  The product stains flooring, does not taste like tea, possibly causes headaches, and is packaged in a plastic that is difficult to recycle.<br /><br />.000001 stars out of 5\\n',\n",

I have truly missed sprinkling adobo on chicken, steaks, fish, and see food.  I've tried all of the no salt seasonings available at the super-market (Mrs Dash, etc.) but, have not been impressed.  Most lack real flavor and rely too heavily on black pepper.  The only Mrs Dash seasoning I like is the steak grilling blend. Now that I have found the Marshall's Creek products It's like heaven.  I can have my adobo and stay healthy. The flavor of this Marshall's Creek Adobo is similar to the name brand but,  has more turmeric than the name brand.  I have used it on beef and chicken so far and it is just as good as the original minus the salt.  I will definitely buy this again.  The seller packed the jars so well and they arrived very quickly.

The issue I have is in preparation.  I have made many of these, and almost every time I am sure to prepare it exactly as instructed and each time the water ends up boiling over the side, making a mess of the seasoning all along the edge of the bowl and leaving the liquid in the bottom of the microwave for cleanup.  They are good enough that I don't mind the cleanup, but, you would think they would package it a little differently so there wouldn't be issues.  I have tried a little less water, which usually helps, but it leaves the noodles a little dry.  Regardless, I would recommend these, just put a few paper towels under the package when microwaving.\\n\",\n",

Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K-Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.<br /><br />There are other great brands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along.\\n\",\n",

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!\\n\",\n",

       " \" I love Timothy's Columbian Decaf coffee, and the fact that I can get 50 K-cups per order from them is great!  I save money and I have a perfect cup of flavorful coffee every time I make a cup. Many people claim they don't like decaf coffee because it doesn't taste like regular coffee, but I challenge anyone to taste Timothy's Columbian Decaf and then tell me that it isn't a great tasting cup of coffee.\\n\",\n",
       " ' SWEET POTATO<br />Pros:<br />- Amazing Taste<br />- Good packaging, almost no chips ever broken, all full shape.<br />- Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)<br />- Perfect serving in the bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hard to open the bag<br /><br />These chips are now my favorite brand, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big \"retail box\" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.<br /><br />For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other branded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good.\\n',\n",
